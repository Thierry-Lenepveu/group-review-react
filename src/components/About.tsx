				Meet Thierry, the photographer who believes every picture tells a
				story—especially the ones where he accidentally captures his own
				reflection in the lens! With a knack for turning even the most mundane
				moments into epic adventures, he’s known for his signature style: the
				'unintentional photobomb.' When he’s not behind the camera, you can find
				him trying to convince his dog to model, which usually ends in a game of
				chase instead of a photoshoot. Thierry is on a mission to prove that
				every click is just a snapshot away from becoming a masterpiece—or a
				hilarious blooper!
